# School District Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to prepare standardized test data from each highshool district-wide for analysis, reporting and presentation.  The results of this analysis will be used to inform the district of performance trends and patterns.  This study will highlight possible causation variables to provide insight and understanding for resource allocation and policy administration to maximize district performance in the areas of math and reading.  


## Metrics and Variables
This study contains two performance metrics:
* Standardized Math Test Scores
* Standardized Reading Test Scores

This study contains the following potential causation variables:
* School Size
* School Type
* School Spending per Capita

## Additional Study
Anomalies were found in the standardized testing at one source.  For this reason, the data from Thomas High School ninth grade was extracted from this study. The district will investigate the anomalies and take appropriate action.  Regardless, results from this study compared to the full data set were nearly identical.   

## Deliverables 
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting results of the study are found in the Appendix.
  * Table 1: Top 5 Performing Schools by Overall Pass Rate
  * Table 2: Bottom 5 Performing Schools by Overall Pass Rate
  * Table 3: Math Performance at Each School by Grade
  * Table 4: Reading Performance at Each School by Grade
  * Table 5: Performance Based Upon School Size
  * Table 6: Performance Based Upon School Type
  * Table 7: Performance Based Upon Spending

## Methodology
This analysis was completed using Python code in Jupyter Noter using Pandas.  

Data was input into the program via csv import of the following two files provided by the district: 
* schools_complete.csv
* students_complete.csv
