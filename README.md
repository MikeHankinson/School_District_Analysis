# School_District_Analysis
Prepare all school district standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation.  Use Python/Jupyter Notebook.  

Deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * Schol performance based on the budget per student
  * School performance based on the school size 
  * School performance based on the type of school
 
    * test
