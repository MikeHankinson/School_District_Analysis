# School District Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to prepare standardized test data from each highshool district-wide for analysis, reporting and presentation.  The results of this analysis will be used to inform the district of performance trends and patterns.  This study will highlight possible causation variables to provide insight and understanding for resource allocation and policy administration to maximize district performance in the areas of math and reading.  


## Metrics and Variables
This study contains two performance metrics:
*Standardized Math Test Scores
*Standardized Reading Test Scores

## Deliverables 
for the analysis of the school district: 
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * Schol performance based on the budget per student
  * School performance based on the school size 
  * School performance based on the type of school
 
    * test
